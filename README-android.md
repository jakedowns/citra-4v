# Android Performance Ideas

### Asynchronous Shader Compilation?
ðŸ’¡ asynchronous shader compilation is probably a bad idea, tiered shader compilation thoughâ€¦â€¦ lots of effort
> The idea is that if you have two compilers, one fast at compiling but generates slow code, and one slow at compiling but generates fast code,
> you can use the first and replace it with the second when it completes.
> Citra has a shader compiler that runs shaders on the CPU
> which could be used as a first tier
> and the slower hardware shaders would be the second tier
> This of course assumes that shaders are the issue to begin with

## Android Devices can be notoriously bad about throttling. What have we tried to prevent CPU from throttling?

### Copy Drastic's trick to keep thread on BIG core
> We've looked into doing what drastic does: keep the process running intense math instructions to keep it on a hot core. Iirc it didn't help because Citra is already heavy enough.

> drastic's math thing was designed to trick classic big.LITTLE with only 2 core clusters (that's what I have on my phone), but in Qualcomm's mess of prime/gold/silver cores, it would seem we need to increase the load on the JIT thread itself so that thread stays scheduled on the correct core at the correct frequencies.

### How about `setSustainedPerformanceMode`?
ðŸ’¡ [Android Source > AOSP > Configure > Power > Performance Management > Sustained Performance](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/performance)
> at least on Snapdragon 845 (Lume Pad) enabling this option doesn't seem to help
> TODO could at least add it as a configurable option for users to test on other chipsets

### Have we tried `setThreadPriority`?
> setThreadPriority won't help unprivileged applications aren't allowed to set niceness < 0, and Android apparently will already give you -2 when you're the foreground app.

### Allow Frame Skip?
Q: could we enable frameskipping for android? 30fps locked is better than stuttery 40-60fps
> We can't do frame skipping reliably because the 3DS renders to arbitrary frame buffers in memory. The DS was probably the last console you could get away with that.
